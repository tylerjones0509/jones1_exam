    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hello! My name is Tyler Jones, and I am currently completing my last semester of the MMIS program at Georgia College. I graduated with an undergraduate degree in Accounting and am also preparing for the CPA exam. It's been an exciting journey as I work toward my professional goals in accounting and auditing.</p>

    <p>I recently moved to Alpharetta, Georgia, where I’ve been enjoying the suburban lifestyle. Outside of work and studies, I enjoy playing golf and spending time with my friends and family. Golf has been a great way to relax, and I try to hit the course whenever I get the chance!</p>

    <p>In the future, I hope to continue growing in my career and work as an Audit Associate at Frazier & Deeter. I am looking forward to applying the skills and knowledge I’ve gained in school to help clients meet their financial goals.</p>
